> **From Open Source, Back to Open Source**

Thinktank.ai is an open-source **super agent harness** that orchestrates **sub-agents**, **memory**, and **sandboxes** to do almost anything — powered by **extensible skills**.

---

## 🚀 Core Features

* **Skills & Tools**: With built-in and extensible skills and tools, Thinktank.ai can do almost anything.
* **Sub-Agents**: Sub-Agents help the main agent to do the tasks that are too complex to be done by the main agent.
* **Sandbox & File System**: Safely execute code and manipulate files in the sandbox.
* **Context Engineering**: Isolated sub-agent context, summarization to keep the context window sharp.
* **Long-Term Memory**: Keep recording the user's profile, top of mind, and conversation history.
