# Frontend production environment variables
# These are injected at BUILD TIME by Vite (must be prefixed with VITE_)
#
# When the frontend is served from the same domain as the backend (via nginx),
# leave these empty to use same-origin API calls (recommended for Docker deployment).
#
# When deploying frontend to a separate CDN/domain, set these to the backend URL:
#   VITE_BACKEND_BASE_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com
#   VITE_LANGGRAPH_BASE_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com/api/langgraph
VITE_BACKEND_BASE_URL=
