# when you add new variables to `.env`.

# This file will be committed to version control, so make sure not to have any
# secrets in it. If you are cloning this repo, create a copy of this file named
# ".env" and populate it with your secrets.

# Leave these empty or commented out to use the nginx proxy (recommended for make dev and Docker)
